# Deploying a Flask API

This is the project starter repo for the fourth course in the [Udacity Full Stack Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd004): Server Deployment, Containerization, and Testing.

In this project you will containerize and deploy a Flask API to a Kubernetes cluster using Docker, AWS EKS, CodePipeline, and CodeBuild.

The Flask app that will be used for this project consists of a simple API with three endpoints:

- `GET '/'`: This is a simple health check, which returns the response 'Healthy'. 
- `POST '/auth'`: This takes a email and password as json arguments and returns a JWT based on a custom secret.
- `GET '/contents'`: This requires a valid JWT, and returns the un-encrpyted contents of that token. 

The app relies on a secret set as the environment variable `JWT_SECRET` to produce a JWT. The built-in Flask server is adequate for local development, but not production, so you will be using the production-ready [Gunicorn](https://gunicorn.org/) server when deploying the app.

## Initial setup
1. Fork this project to your Github account.
2. Locally clone your forked version to begin working on the project.

## Dependencies

- Docker Engine
    - Installation instructions for all OSes can be found [here](https://docs.docker.com/install/).
    - For Mac users, if you have no previous Docker Toolbox installation, you can install Docker Desktop for Mac. If you already have a Docker Toolbox installation, please read [this](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/docker-toolbox/) before installing.
 - AWS Account
     - You can create an AWS account by signing up [here](https://aws.amazon.com/#).
     
## Project Steps

Completing the project involves several steps:

1. Write a Dockerfile for a simple Flask API
2. Build and test the container locally
3. Create an EKS cluster
4. Store a secret using AWS Parameter Store
5. Create a CodePipeline pipeline triggered by GitHub checkins
6. Create a CodeBuild stage which will build, test, and deploy your code

For more detail about each of these steps, see the project lesson [here](https://learn.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd0044-alg-t2-fr/parts/2a7a2833-4109-4c7f-87ac-93e213209857/lessons/3338f822-25a7-455b-b962-43669d4683ad/concepts/28ffd7db-3df3-43fc-ac9b-22976b6592dc).
